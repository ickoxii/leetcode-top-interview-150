 /**
  * You are given an array of variable pairs equations 
  * and an array of real numbers values, where
  * equations[i] = [A_i, B_i] and values[i] represent
  * the equation A_i / B_i = values[i]. Each A_i or B_i
  * is a string that represents a single variable.
  *
  * You are also given some queries, where
  * queries[j] = [C_j, D_j] represents the j_th query
  * where you must find the answer for C_j / D_j = ?.
  *
  * Return the answers to all queries. If a single
  * answer cannot be dtermined, return -1.0.
  *
  * Note: the input is always valid. there is no division
  * by zero and there is no contradiction
  *
  * Note: variables that do not occur in the list of
  * equations are undefined, so the answer cannot be
  * determined for them. */
